description: Najaea is an internal Project from Advance with a clear target of becoming a [data driven company](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Data-Driven-Organization-Practical-Trenches/dp/1491916915). A lots of software doing this job are here to punish, but we wanted to create a more costructive culture, however we should expose internally our successes and failures, that's why we developed a software, based on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), to do the evaluation of the tech team. We plugged [Redash](http://redash.io/) on top, to expose it on the TV, and have a fancy interface.
